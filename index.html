          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos Marighella was a Marxist Brazilian writer, politician and guerilla fighter who lived during the 20th century.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marighella was born in Salvador, Bahia, to Italian immigrant Augusto Marighella and Afro-Brazilian Maria Rita do Nascimento. His father was a blue-collar worker originally from Emilia, while his mother was a descendant of African slaves, brought from
     Sudan (Hausa blacks). He spent his young life at a house in Rua do Desterro, at the Baixa do Sapateiro neighbourhood, where he would graduate from primary and secondary education. In 1934, he left the Polytechnic School of Bahia, where he was pursuing
     a degree in civil engineering, in order to become an active member of the Brazilian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Brasileiro - PCB). He then moved to Rio de Janeiro to work in the restructuring of PCB.
          </p>
          <p>He was shot by police at an ambush at 8pm on 4 November 1969 at 800 Alameda Casa Branca, São Paulo. This ambush was organized by police deputy Sérgio Paranhos Fleury, known for his work inside Department of Social and Political Order (Departamento de Ordem Política e Social - DOPS).</p>
